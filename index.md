# Git Basics
* What is Git?
#### Git is a version control system that will track all your files and any changes made to them to boil it down. It does this by your commits you make, each commit Git will go through your lines of code and see which lines have changed and save those into the "timeline" which is just a snapshot of how it looked at the moment of the commit. This gives you a history of your commits you have made that you can reference back to, or just revert back to a specific commit you made. Git can be linear in this "timeline" but it doesn't have to be, Git also allows you to branch from your main root repository to allow you to work on your projects without any changes made to the main project. If your trying to work on some code for a specific feature or working collaboratively and the project is divided out to each member each person can work in another branch without affecting the main project, and then can later be merged together. Now, Git has three main states that your files can be in, there's the modified, staged, and commited states.
